Financial Peace University Packet Pickup Project
================================================

This is a project we did for our own Church, Bellevue Baptist Church.
We were hosting about 80 classes spreadout across many times and every day of the week, with different start dates.
The idea was that we would get everybody at our church signed up for these classes, 
and invite many from outside the church as well.
This means that we signed up about 1,000 people using the TouchPoint system.

Part of the signup process involved allowing a registrant to choose to purchase a packet, one per couple, 
or indicate that they already had a packet because they had aready attended FPU previously.

The packets could be picked up starting a few days before the first class 
and would continue for several weeks during the various start dates for individual classes.

Because the packets are expensive ($80) a good accounting of when a person (could be an individual, or husband or wife) picked up the packet.

Because couples would share the packet, 
both husband and wife would need to be marked as having paid and picked-up if of them had picked up their packet.

Also, we needed a way to verify that they had indeed already paid for a packet during the online registration.

The registrant would receive an email confirmation with a bar-code embedded with their class and peopleid. 
This confirmation could either be printed or presented electronically on their smart-phone.
Then we would scan their barcode when they picked up their packet.

We are documenting how this project worked here because of the way we integrated 
it into Touchpoint through the use of Python Scripts while making it appear as an integral part of TouchPoint.

Here are the various components:
